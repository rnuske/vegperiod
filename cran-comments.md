This is a minor update. The maintainer stays the same, but the email address changed.

This package checks okay locally on ubuntu 20.04 R-release, all win-builder flavors, macOS builder, Rhub's check_for_cran suite and Github Actions CI.

I checked that the reverse dependency compiles and checks --as-cran okay with this version of vegperiod.
