\title{Fetch list of DWD weather stations}
\usage{
read.DWDstations(type = "climate", period = "recent", resolution = "daily")
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{string. Stations can be of type \samp{"climate"} offering a range
of meteorological parameters or of type \samp{"precipitation"} solely
recording rainfall.}

\item{period}{string specifying a time span. The last 1.5 years are
called \samp{"recent"}. Data from the individual beginning of measurements
up to a year ago are labelled \samp{"historical"}.}

\item{resolution}{string. Temporal resolution of the data can be
\samp{"daily"} or \samp{"monthly"}. \samp{"daily"} being the common
resolution.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with all weather stations. It's not guaranteed that all
  advertised staions are available for download. Watch out for the end data
  of observation. Stations with recent data have a current end date.
  The data.frame contains the variables id, from, to, elev, lat, long, name,
  state.

\description{
Get a listing of advertised stations of Germany's National Meteorological
Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). The list differs for station type,
time period and resolution. The list of advertised stations is usually not
identical with currently available stations.

\details{
The freely accessible part of the Climate Data Center of Germany's National
Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) is part of DWD's
mandate for basic supply of information (termed "Grundversorgung").
This service may be used without any restrictions (no fees will be
charged and in general there are no restrictions for the use the data),
provided that the source is indicated as laid down in the
\href{http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/geonutzv/BJNR054700013.html}{"GeoNutzV"}
ordinance. The source reference shall roughly meet the following rules:
\itemize{
  \item Where data are used without modification, the source reference shall
    read "Source: Deutscher Wetterdienst" or just consist of the DWD logo.
  \item If the data are modified, the source reference shall specify as
    precisely as possible the extent of such, e.g. "Based on data from
    Deutscher Wetterdienst, figures rounded".
}
A more detailed description of the rules can be found in the official and
legally binding German
\href{https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/Nutzungsbedingungen_German.pdf}{Nutzungsbedingungen}
or the translated \href{https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/Terms_of_use.pdf}{Terms
of use}.
